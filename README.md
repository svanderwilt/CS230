# CS230
# This document was created for The Gaming Room.  The client wants to convert their Android app to a app that can be played on computers and iOS as well. The recommended requirements are presented in CS230 Project Design Document.
# I thought the solution I came up with for the client to create a web app to go along with the mobile app all served by the same server was done particularly well.
# I would revise the recommendation part and go into more details about cloud computing requirements as that is the approach I think the company should take.
# I got a list of requirements from the client and interpreted them to my best ability.  It is important to understand the clients needs when designing because any mistinterpertations early in the process become major issues later.
# I approached this design primarily with analyzing the user's requirements.  After fully understanding them, I researched all possible tools and costs associated with meeting those requirements and presented my recommendations based on that.  I would follow similar stategies in the future, although I imagine as I gain more expertise the recommendations will become more intuitive.  However, I will continue to make sure the requirements are completely understood before moving on.
